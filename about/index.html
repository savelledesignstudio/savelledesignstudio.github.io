"Savelle played a central role in elevating Atana's digital presence during a period when we were juggling a lot of moving parts. He contributed to nearly every area of our front-end experience, including navigation, blog structure, email templates, landing pages, and even the training portal. He handled all of it while working within the constraints of our existing Salesforce and Magento systems, which required both creativity and patience.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
What stood out to me was his ability to maintain a high standard of design while staying grounded in the practical needs of the business and the realities of our audience. He understood that our workplace training users needed clarity above all else, and he consistently delivered solutions that balanced usability, brand consistency, and visual quality.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
He was also an excellent remote collaborator. He communicated clearly, responded quickly, and reliably turned high-level or ambiguous requests into work that needed very little refinement. That kind of partnership made my job significantly easier. If you are looking for someone who can work across a wide variety of digital projects, adapt to your existing platforms, and bring a thoughtful balance of design intuition and business sense, don't hesitate to hire Savelle."

"Working with Savelle wasn't like working with a typical designer - it felt more like having a co-founder who just happened to be insanely talented at UX. When we were drowning in the complexity of 13 RV dealership locations and needed customers to actually find what they were looking for, Savelle didn't just design a filter system. He got in the weeds with us, understood our sales team's pain points, and built something that made everyone's life easier. That's rare.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
Then we threw him the Van Up curveball - a completely new brand, e-commerce platform, service tracker, and lifestyle blog all rolled into one. Most designers would've buckled under that scope. Savelle thrived. He helped us figure out who we were as a brand while simultaneously building the entire digital experience from scratch.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
What I appreciated most was that he never made us feel like 'the client' - he made us feel like collaborators. He'd push back when our ideas were overcomplicated, suggest things we hadn't thought of, and move fast without cutting corners. When you're launching something new, that kind of partnership is everything.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
If you need someone who can think strategically, move quickly, and actually give a damn about whether your business succeeds - not just whether the design looks pretty - call Savelle. Just be ready to keep up, because he doesn't mess around."

"Savelle is one of the most talented UX experts I've had the pleasure of working with. Within a very short period of time after his hire, he was knocking out work items and client side code. The impact of his effort and his work will be felt for a very long time. It seemed like every day, he was revealing a new talent. My favorite Savelle anecdote is the time he re-designed the product logo, and came up with something better than the marketing company effort after doodling for about 10 minutes. Simply amazing.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
On the team he was the go-to "finisher" for his development-side colleagues. His ability to quickly turn "programmer UI" into something awesome is a super power. Savelle is patient and has a pretty solid understanding of that middle ground between development and the desired outcome of an elegant design. His communication skills are second to none in this area.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
His grasp of design processes around UI/UX is clear in his work. Savelle was a frequent collaborator within the dev process and is a key reason the application has been received with praise universally by customers and investors.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
I could always count on Savelle to be positive, solution oriented, and supportive of his fellow teammates at any given time of the journey. Savelle is one of the most creative guys I've had the pleasure to work with, and cannot stress enough how much his presence, sense of humor, talents and foodie opinions adds to the team dynamic. I would hire/work with Savelle again without hesitation. I can't wait to see what he does next!"
